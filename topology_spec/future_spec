Overview

What is the objective?

The objective is to bring SDI to legacy. Subsequent orchestration
should be easier. If orchestration subsequently becomes more challenging
then this system has a net cost. Specifically, the region/provider of each node
should be chosen by default.



Focus on the most important things

Substrate 

Think of integration of substrate topology.

Cost function integration etc.

Edges:
bandwidth- The bandwidth requested for this channel.

secure- Whether this channel is secure e.g. uses IPSec or VPN tunnels or is insecure, e.g. VXLAN tunnel.
